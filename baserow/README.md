# Baserow

From the baserow website:

> Baserow is an open-source online database tool. Users can use this no-code platform to create a database without any technical experience. It lowers the barriers to app creation so that anyone who can work with a spreadsheet can also create a database. The interface looks a lot like a spreadsheet. Our goal is to provide a perfect and fast user experience while keeping it easy for developers to write plugins and maintain the codebase. The developer documentation contains several topics you might need as a developer.

So it seems like an easy way to prototype little things that use some data,
but don't need that much data,
and would benefit from an easy way to manually edit data.
